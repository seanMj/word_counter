Three Version:
1.) using iterators and pointers, just for fun and warm-up

def not my best code, but not my worst either... actually its ugly, and you know it, regardless how quick it is its quit... ugly and ineffective.... im going to rewrite this when i get my barings, or think of a better desgin

this is an example of poorly written code in my opinion... doesnt make sense - confusing function names, and no documentation..

this is an exaple of what not to do.
2.) what you can do, but should'nt because there is no point... maybe on microsoft... but linux is no issue.
3.) how it should be formatted and written - nice clean code, well formed and well written.
